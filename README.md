# UOR Foundation Research

This repository is the official open-source research directory of the UOR Foundation. It contains foundational mathematical and scientific frameworks developed to enable rigorous validation, interoperability, and scalable discovery.

Each project represents an independent research initiative with full version history preserved. All code and formal structures are openly available for use, verification, extension, and integration into other research efforts.

We invite researchers, mathematicians, engineers, and independent contributors to build upon this work, apply it within their own domains, and submit improvements. The goal is simple: accelerate scientific breakthroughs through open collaboration, formal rigor, and shared infrastructure.
