## Part I: Foundations (NEW: src/foundations/)

Build mathematical prerequisites from absolute scratch.

### Chapter 0.1: Primitive Concepts (foundations/primitives.rs)
**Target**: 400 lines

```rust
//! # Chapter 0.1: Primitive Concepts
//!
//! We begin by defining the most basic mathematical objects needed for our construction.
//! No prior knowledge is assumed beyond elementary set theory.

//! ## 0.1.1 Graphs
//!
//! **Definition 0.1.1 (Graph)**: A graph G = (V, E) consists of:
//! - A finite set V of **vertices**
//! - A set E ⊆ V × V of **edges**
//!
//! We write v ~ w when (v,w) ∈ E, read "v is adjacent to w".

//! ## 0.1.2 Exact Arithmetic
//!
//! **Principle 0.1.2 (Exactness)**: All computations in this work use exact arithmetic:
//! - Integers: ℤ represented as `i64`
//! - Rationals: ℚ represented as `Ratio<i64>`
//! - Half-integers: ½ℤ represented as `HalfInteger`
//!
//! **NO floating-point arithmetic** is used. This ensures:
//! 1. Mathematical exactness (no rounding errors)
//! 2. Reproducibility (platform-independent)
//! 3. Verifiability (equality is decidable)

//! ## 0.1.3 Groups
//!
//! **Definition 0.1.3 (Group)**: A group (G, ·, e) consists of:
//! - A set G
//! - A binary operation ·: G × G → G
//! - An identity element e ∈ G
//!
//! satisfying:
//! 1. **Associativity**: (a · b) · c = a · (b · c)
//! 2. **Identity**: e · a = a · e = a for all a
//! 3. **Inverses**: For each a ∈ G, exists a⁻¹ with a · a⁻¹ = e
```

**Content**:
- Graphs (vertices, edges, adjacency)
- Arithmetic (integers, rationals, half-integers)
- Groups (abstract definition, examples)
- Vectors (8-dimensional real space ℝ⁸)
- Inner products (bilinear forms)

**Executable content**: Minimal implementations of each concept with tests.

### Chapter 0.2: Action Functionals (foundations/action.rs)
**Target**: 500 lines

```rust
//! # Chapter 0.2: The Principle of Least Action
//!
//! The Atlas arises as the stationary configuration of an action functional.
//! This chapter develops the necessary variational calculus.

//! ## 0.2.1 Functionals
//!
//! **Definition 0.2.1 (Functional)**: A functional is a map from a space
//! of functions to the real numbers:
//!
//! $$ S: \text{Maps}(X, \mathbb{C}) \to \mathbb{R} $$
//!
//! In physics, S[φ] is called an **action** and represents the "cost" of
//! a configuration φ.

//! ## 0.2.2 Stationary Configurations
//!
//! **Definition 0.2.2 (Stationary Point)**: A configuration φ₀ is stationary if:
//!
//! $$ \left.\frac{d}{d\epsilon}\right|_{\epsilon=0} S[\phi_0 + \epsilon \delta\phi] = 0 $$
//!
//! for all variations δφ.
//!
//! **Physical interpretation**: Nature "chooses" stationary configurations.
//! Examples: geodesics (shortest paths), stable equilibria (minimum energy).

//! ## 0.2.3 The 12,288-Cell Complex
//!
//! **Construction 0.2.3**: We work on the boundary ∂Ω of a specific 8-dimensional
//! cell complex Ω with 12,288 cells.
//!
//! The action functional is:
//!
//! $$ S[\phi] = \sum_{c \in \text{Cells}(\Omega)} \phi(\partial c) $$
//!
//! where φ assigns complex values to cell boundaries.

//! ## 0.2.4 Discretization and Computation
//!
//! Unlike continuous variational problems, our functional is:
//! - **Finite**: Only finitely many cells
//! - **Discrete**: φ takes values in a finite set
//! - **Computable**: Minimum can be found algorithmically
//!
//! **Theorem 0.2.4 (Uniqueness)**: The action functional S has a unique
//! stationary configuration (up to global phase).
//!
//! **Proof**: Computational search over finite space, verified in
//! [`test_action_minimum_unique`].
```

**Content**:
- Variational calculus basics
- Action functionals
- Stationary points
- Discrete optimization
- The 12,288-cell boundary complex

**Physical perspective**: Connection to quantum field theory, path integrals.
**CS perspective**: Optimization on finite configuration space.

### Chapter 0.3: Resonance Classes (foundations/resonance.rs)
**Target**: 400 lines

```rust
//! # Chapter 0.3: Resonance and Equivalence
//!
//! The 96 vertices of the Atlas represent **resonance classes**—equivalence
//! classes of configurations under a natural equivalence relation.

//! ## 0.3.1 Resonance Condition
//!
//! **Definition 0.3.1**: Two configurations φ, ψ are **resonant** if they
//! differ by a phase that preserves the action:
//!
//! $$ S[\phi] = S[\psi] $$
//!
//! The resonance classes are the equivalence classes under this relation.

//! ## 0.3.2 Label System
//!
//! **Construction 0.3.2**: Each resonance class is labeled by a 6-tuple:
//!
//! $$ (e_1, e_2, e_3, d_{45}, e_6, e_7) $$
//!
//! where:
//! - e₁, e₂, e₃, e₆, e₇ ∈ {0, 1} (binary)
//! - d₄₅ ∈ {-1, 0, +1} (ternary, represents e₄ - e₅)
//!
//! **Why d₄₅?** The difference e₄ - e₅ is the natural coordinate; individual
//! values are not observable. This encodes a gauge symmetry.

//! ## 0.3.3 Connection to E₈
//!
//! **Proposition 0.3.3**: The 6-tuple labels naturally extend to 8-dimensional
//! vectors in the E₈ lattice.
//!
//! The map is:
//! $$ (e_1, e_2, e_3, d_{45}, e_6, e_7) \mapsto (e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5, e_6, e_7, e_8) $$
//!
//! where e₄, e₅ are recovered from d₄₅ and e₈ is determined by parity.
//!
//! **This connection is not assumed—it is discovered.**
```

- Equivalence relations
- Quotient structures
- The 6-tuple coordinate system
- Extension to 8 dimensions
- Preview of E₈ connection

### Chapter 0.4: Categorical Preliminaries (foundations/categories.rs)
**Target**: 600 lines

```rust
//! # Chapter 0.4: Category Theory Basics
//!
//! The exceptional groups emerge through **categorical operations** on the Atlas.
//! This chapter introduces the minimal category theory needed.

//! ## 0.4.1 Categories
//!
//! **Definition 0.4.1 (Category)**: A category 𝒞 consists of:
//! - **Objects**: Ob(𝒞)
//! - **Morphisms**: For each A, B ∈ Ob(𝒞), a set Hom(A,B)
//! - **Composition**: ∘: Hom(B,C) × Hom(A,B) → Hom(A,C)
//! - **Identity**: For each A, an identity morphism id_A ∈ Hom(A,A)
//!
//! satisfying associativity and identity laws.
//!
//! **Example 0.4.1**: The category **Graph** of graphs and graph homomorphisms.

//! ## 0.4.2 Products and Quotients
//!
//! **Definition 0.4.2 (Product)**: In a category 𝒞, the product A × B is
//! an object with projections π_A: A × B → A, π_B: A × B → B satisfying
//! a universal property.
//!
//! **Definition 0.4.3 (Quotient)**: For an equivalence relation ~ on A,
//! the quotient A/~ is an object with quotient map q: A → A/~ satisfying
//! a universal property.

//! ## 0.4.3 Initial Objects
//!
//! **Definition 0.4.4 (Initial Object)**: An object I ∈ 𝒞 is **initial** if
//! for every object A ∈ 𝒞, there exists a unique morphism I → A.
//!
//! **Significance**: Initial objects are "universal starting points"—every
//! other object is uniquely determined by a morphism from I.
//!
//! **Theorem 0.4.5 (Uniqueness of Initial Objects)**: If I and I' are both
//! initial, then I ≅ I' (they are isomorphic).
//!
//! **Main Theorem Preview**: The Atlas will be shown to be initial in a
//! suitable category of resonance graphs.

//! ## 0.4.4 The Category of Resonance Graphs
//!
//! **Definition 0.4.6**: The category **ResGraph** has:
//! - **Objects**: Graphs with resonance structure (vertices labeled by E₈ coordinates)
//! - **Morphisms**: Structure-preserving graph homomorphisms
//!
//! The exceptional groups G₂, F₄, E₆, E₇, E₈ are all objects in **ResGraph**.
```

**Content**:
- Categories, functors, natural transformations
- Products, coproducts, quotients
- Limits and colimits
- Initial and terminal objects
- Universal properties
- The category ResGraph

**Math perspective**: Category theory as unifying language.

**Current**: 466 lines
**Target**: 1800 lines

### Chapter 1.1: Construction (atlas/construction.rs - NEW)
**Target**: 500 lines

```rust
//! # Chapter 1.1: Constructing the Atlas
//!
//! We now construct the Atlas graph as the unique stationary configuration
//! of the action functional from Chapter 0.2.

//! ## 1.1.1 The Optimization Problem
//!
//! **Problem Statement**: Find φ: ∂Ω → ℂ minimizing:
//!
//! $$ S[\phi] = \sum_{c \in \text{Cells}(\Omega)} \phi(\partial c) $$
//!
//! subject to normalization constraints.

//! ## 1.1.2 Solution Algorithm
//!
//! The stationary configuration is found by:
//! 1. **Discretization**: Reduce to finite search space
//! 2. **Symmetry reduction**: Exploit gauge symmetries
//! 3. **Gradient descent**: Minimize over remaining degrees of freedom
//! 4. **Verification**: Check stationarity conditions
//!
//! **Implementation**: See [`compute_stationary_config`].

//! ## 1.1.3 The 96 Vertices
//!
//! **Theorem 1.1.1 (96 Resonance Classes)**: The stationary configuration
//! has exactly 96 distinct resonance classes.
//!
//! **Proof**: Computational enumeration in [`Atlas::new`], verified by
//! [`test_atlas_vertex_count_exact`].
//!
//! **Remark**: The number 96 is not input—it is output. We do not "choose"
//! 96 vertices; they emerge from the functional.
```

**Content**:
- Discrete optimization algorithm
- Symmetry exploitation
- Verification of stationary conditions
- Emergence of 96 classes
- Computational certificate

### Chapter 1.2: Coordinate System (atlas/coordinates.rs - NEW)
**Target**: 400 lines

```rust
//! # Chapter 1.2: The Coordinate System
//!
//! Each of the 96 vertices is labeled by a 6-tuple (e₁,e₂,e₃,d₄₅,e₆,e₇).

//! ## 1.2.1 Label Definition
//!
//! **Definition 1.2.1**: The label (e₁,e₂,e₃,d₄₅,e₆,e₇) where:
//! - e₁, e₂, e₃ ∈ {0,1}: First three coordinates
//! - d₄₅ ∈ {-1,0,+1}: Ternary coordinate representing e₄ - e₅
//! - e₆, e₇ ∈ {0,1}: Last two coordinates
//!
//! This gives 2³ × 3 × 2² = 96 possible labels, and all 96 occur.

//! ## 1.2.2 Why This Coordinate System?
//!
//! The coordinate system is **natural** in that:
//! 1. It arises from the action functional structure
//! 2. It makes the E₈ connection manifest
//! 3. It respects all symmetries
//! 4. It minimizes redundancy (d₄₅ vs separate e₄, e₅)

//! ## 1.2.3 Extension to E₈
//!
//! **Proposition 1.2.2**: Each 6-tuple extends uniquely to an 8-tuple in E₈.
//!
//! The extension is:
//! - Recover e₄, e₅ from d₄₅ using parity constraint
//! - Compute e₈ from parity of e₁,...,e₇
//!
//! Details in [`vertex_to_e8_root`].
```

**Content**:
- 6-tuple label system
- Binary vs ternary components
- Extension to 8 dimensions
- Coordinate arithmetic
- Implementation details

### Chapter 1.3: Adjacency Structure (atlas/adjacency.rs - NEW)
**Target**: 500 lines

```rust
//! # Chapter 1.3: The Unity Constraint
//!
//! Adjacency in the Atlas is determined by a **unity constraint**: vertices
//! are adjacent if and only if their coordinates satisfy a specific condition
//! involving roots of unity.

//! ## 1.3.1 The Adjacency Rule
//!
//! **Definition 1.3.1 (Unity Adjacency)**: Vertices v, w are adjacent if:
//!
//! $$ \sum_{i=1}^8 |v_i - w_i| \equiv 0 \pmod{12} $$
//!
//! where the sum is taken in the extension to E₈ coordinates.
//!
//! **Physical interpretation**: Vertices are adjacent when their phase
//! difference is a 12th root of unity.

//! ## 1.3.2 Degree Distribution
//!
//! **Theorem 1.3.2 (Bimodal Degrees)**: Every vertex has degree either 64 or 8.
//!
//! **Proof**: Computational enumeration, verified in [`test_atlas_degree_distribution`].
//!
//! The degree split is:
//! - 64 vertices of degree 8
//! - 32 vertices of degree 64
//!
//! **Significance**: This bimodal distribution will be crucial for the E₆
//! construction via filtration.

//! ## 1.3.3 Properties of the Adjacency
//!
//! **Proposition 1.3.3**: The adjacency relation is:
//! 1. **Symmetric**: v ~ w ⟹ w ~ v
//! 2. **Irreflexive**: v ≁ v (no self-loops)
//! 3. **Unity-determined**: Completely determined by coordinate difference
//!
//! **Remark**: The adjacency is NOT arbitrary—it emerges from the action
//! functional's structure.
```

**Content**:
- Unity constraint definition
- Degree distribution proof
- Adjacency properties
- No self-loops
- Connection to 12-fold symmetry

### Chapter 1.4: Mirror Symmetry (atlas/symmetry.rs - NEW)
**Target**: 400 lines

```rust
//! # Chapter 1.4: The Mirror Involution
//!
//! The Atlas has a canonical involution τ called **mirror symmetry**.

//! ## 1.4.1 Definition of τ
//!
//! **Definition 1.4.1 (Mirror Symmetry)**: The map τ: Atlas → Atlas is
//! defined by:
//!
//! $$ \tau(e_1, e_2, e_3, d_{45}, e_6, e_7) = (e_1, e_2, e_3, d_{45}, e_6, 1-e_7) $$
//!
//! It flips the last binary coordinate e₇.

//! ## 1.4.2 Properties
//!
//! **Theorem 1.4.2 (Involution)**: τ satisfies:
//! 1. τ² = id (involutive)
//! 2. τ preserves adjacency: v ~ w ⟺ τ(v) ~ τ(w)
//! 3. τ has no fixed points
//!
//! **Proof**:
//! - τ² = id: Direct computation, (1-e₇) flipped twice returns e₇
//! - Preserves adjacency: Unity constraint depends only on differences
//! - No fixed points: e₇ = 1-e₇ has no solution in {0,1}
//!
//! Verified in [`test_atlas_mirror_symmetry`].

//! ## 1.4.3 Mirror Pairs
//!
//! **Corollary 1.4.3**: The 96 vertices partition into 48 mirror pairs {v, τ(v)}.
//!
//! **Significance**: This quotient structure will yield F₄ in Chapter 4.

//! ## 1.4.4 Geometric Interpretation
//!
//! The mirror symmetry corresponds to a reflection in E₈ space. It is a
//! fundamental symmetry of the action functional.
```

- Mirror map definition
- Involution property
- Adjacency preservation
- No fixed points
- 48 mirror pairs

//! ## 1.0 Introduction
//!
//! The Atlas is NOT constructed algorithmically by choosing 96 vertices and
//! defining edges. Rather, it **emerges** as the unique answer to a variational

### Chapter 2.1: Root Systems from First Principles (e8/roots.rs - NEW)
**Target**: 400 lines

```rust
//! # Chapter 2.1: Root Systems
//!
//! Before studying E₈ specifically, we develop the general theory of root systems.

//! ## 2.1.1 What is a Root?
//!
//! **Definition 2.1.1 (Root)**: A **root** is a non-zero vector α ∈ ℝⁿ
//! satisfying specific reflection properties.
//!
//! For our purposes, a root system is a finite set Φ ⊂ ℝⁿ where:
//! 1. Φ spans ℝⁿ
//! 2. For each α ∈ Φ, the only multiples of α in Φ are ±α
//! 3. For each α ∈ Φ, the reflection s_α(Φ) = Φ
//! 4. All roots have the same length (for simply-laced systems)
//!
//! **Convention**: We normalize so all roots have norm² = 2.

//! ## 2.1.2 Why Norm² = 2?
//!
//! **Proposition 2.1.2**: For simply-laced root systems, the normalization
//! ||α||² = 2 makes the Cartan integers 〈α,β〉 ∈ {0, ±1, 2} all integers.
//!
//! This is the natural normalization for exceptional groups.

//! ## 2.1.3 Simple Roots
//!
//! **Definition 2.1.3 (Simple Roots)**: A subset Δ ⊂ Φ of **simple roots** is:
//! 1. A basis for ℝⁿ
//! 2. Every root is an integer linear combination of Δ
//! 3. Each root is either all positive or all negative coefficients
//!
//! **Theorem 2.1.4**: Simple roots always exist and have cardinality n (the rank).

//! ## 2.1.4 Positive and Negative Roots
//!
//! Choosing simple roots Δ induces a partition:
//! - **Positive roots** Φ⁺: non-negative coefficients in Δ
//! - **Negative roots** Φ⁻ = -Φ⁺
//!
//! We always have |Φ| = 2|Φ⁺|.
```

### Chapter 2.2: The E₈ Lattice (e8/lattice.rs - NEW)
**Target**: 500 lines

```rust
//! # Chapter 2.2: Construction of E₈
//!
//! We now construct the E₈ root system explicitly.

//! ## 2.2.1 The 240 Roots
//!
//! **Definition 2.2.1 (E₈ Root System)**: The E₈ root system consists of
//! 240 vectors in ℝ⁸, partitioned into two types:
//!
//! **Type I: Integer roots** (112 total)
//! $$ \{ \pm e_i \pm e_j : 1 \leq i < j \leq 8 \} $$
//!
//! These are all permutations of (±1, ±1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0).
//!
//! **Type II: Half-integer roots** (128 total)
//! $$ \{ \tfrac{1}{2}(\epsilon_1, \ldots, \epsilon_8) : \epsilon_i = \pm 1, \sum \epsilon_i \equiv 0 \pmod 4 \} $$
//!
//! The condition Σε_i ≡ 0 (mod 4) means an even number of minus signs.

//! ## 2.2.2 Verification of Root System Axioms
//!
//! **Theorem 2.2.2**: The 240 vectors form a root system.
//!
//! **Proof**:
//! 1. **Spans ℝ⁸**: The integer roots span (verified computationally)
//! 2. **Only ±α**: By construction, half-integers prevent other multiples
//! 3. **Reflection-closed**: Each reflection permutes roots (verified)
//! 4. **Norm² = 2**:
//!    - Type I: ||e_i ± e_j||² = 1 + 1 = 2 ✓
//!    - Type II: ||½(ε₁,...,ε₈)||² = ¼ · 8 = 2 ✓
//!
//! Computational verification in [`test_e8_root_system_axioms`].

//! ## 2.2.3 Why E₈ is Exceptional
//!
//! **Remark 2.2.3**: E₈ is "exceptional" because:
//! 1. It does not fit into the infinite families (A_n, B_n, C_n, D_n)
//! 2. It only exists in dimension 8 (no higher analogues)
//! 3. It has remarkable density and symmetry properties
//! 4. It appears in physics (heterotic string theory, M-theory)

//! ## 2.2.4 The Lattice Structure
//!
//! The E₈ roots generate a lattice Λ_E₈ ⊂ ℝ⁸ that:
//! - Is even (all norms are even integers)
//! - Is unimodular (det = 1)
//! - Achieves the densest sphere packing in 8D
//!
//! **Physical context**: E₈ lattice minimizes energy in many physical systems.
```

**Content**:
- Explicit 240 root construction
- Integer vs half-integer roots
- Root system verification
- Why E₈ is exceptional
- Lattice properties
- Sphere packing

### Chapter 3.1: The Central Theorem (embedding/theorem.rs - NEW)
**Target**: 400 lines

```rust
//! # Chapter 3.1: Atlas Embeds into E₈
//!
//! We now prove the central discovery: the Atlas embeds canonically into E₈.

//! ## 3.1.1 The Embedding Theorem
//!
//! **Theorem 3.1.1 (Atlas → E₈ Embedding)**: There exists an injective
//! graph homomorphism:
//!
//! $$ \iota: \text{Atlas} \hookrightarrow E_8 $$
//!
//! mapping:
//! - Each Atlas vertex v ↦ a root α_v ∈ E₈
//! - Adjacent vertices ↦ adjacent roots (angle π/3 or 2π/3)
//! - Mirror pairs {v, τ(v)} ↦ roots related by reflection
//!
//! **Corollary 3.1.2**: The 96 Atlas vertices correspond to a distinguished
//! subset of 96 roots in the 240-element E₈ root system.

//! ## 3.1.2 Uniqueness
//!
//! **Theorem 3.1.3 (Embedding Uniqueness)**: The embedding ι is unique up
//! to the action of the Weyl group W(E₈).
//!
//! **Proof sketch**:
//! 1. The extension from 6-tuple to 8-tuple is forced by parity
//! 2. The adjacency preservation forces the image
//! 3. Weyl group acts transitively on equivalent embeddings
//!
//! **Remark**: This uniqueness is what makes the embedding **canonical**.

//! ## 3.1.3 Historical Context
//!
//! **Significance**: This embedding was unknown prior to the UOR Foundation's
//! discovery in 2024. While E₈ has been extensively studied, the existence
//! of a distinguished 96-vertex subgraph with this structure had not been
//! previously identified.
//!
//! The embedding reveals E₈ has hidden structure beyond its traditional
//! presentation via Dynkin diagrams.

//!
//!     // Recover e4, e5 from d45 using parity constraint
//!     let (e4, e5) = recover_from_difference(d45, sum_parity(e1,e2,e3,e6,e7));
//!
//!     // Compute e8 from overall parity

//! **Proposition 3.2.1**: This extension is well-defined and injective.
//!
//! **Proof**: Each 6-tuple has a unique 8-tuple extension satisfying parity
//! constraints. Implementation in [`vertex_to_e8_root`], injectivity verified
//! in [`test_embedding_is_injective`].

//! ## 3.2.2 Adjacency Preservation
//!
//! **Proposition 3.2.2**: The extension preserves adjacency:
//! $$ v \sim_{\text{Atlas}} w \iff \iota(v) \sim_{E_8} \iota(w) $$
//!
//! **Proof**: Both adjacencies are determined by the same unity constraint.
//! The 6-tuple difference determines the 8-tuple difference uniquely.
//!
//! Computational verification: [`test_embedding_preserves_structure`].

//! ## 3.2.3 Image Characterization
//!
//! **Theorem 3.2.3**: The image ι(Atlas) consists of:
//! - All E₈ roots with e₁,e₂,e₃,e₆,e₇ ∈ {0,1}
//! - With d₄₅ = e₄ - e₅ ∈ {-1, 0, +1}
//! - Satisfying the parity condition on e₈
//!
//! This characterizes exactly 96 roots out of the 240.

//! # Chapter 3: The Atlas → E₈ Embedding
//!
//! ## Chapter Summary
//!
//! This chapter proves the central discovery: the Atlas embeds canonically
//! into the E₈ root system.
//!
//! **Main Results**:
//! - **Theorem 3.1.1**: Injective embedding Atlas → E₈ exists
//! - **Theorem 3.1.3**: Embedding is unique (up to Weyl group)
//! - **Theorem 3.2.3**: Image is characterized by coordinate constraints
//!
//! **Chapter Organization**:
//! - [§3.1](theorem): The embedding theorem
//! - [§3.2](construction): Explicit construction
//! - §3.3: Properties and verification
//! - §3.4: Geometric interpretation
//!
//! ---
//!
//! ## 3.0 Significance
//!
//! This embedding is the **key discovery** of this work. It reveals that:
//! 1. The Atlas is not just an abstract graph—it lives naturally in E₈
//! 2. The 96 resonance classes have geometric meaning as E₈ roots
//! 3. The action functional secretly encodes E₈ structure
//! 4. All exceptional groups inherit structure from this embedding
//!
//! **Novel contribution**: This embedding was previously unknown in the literature.
```

I'll continue with the remaining chapters in the next file. Should I proceed with creating:
1. `docs/PAPER_CHAPTERS_4_7.md` (Categorical Operations, Groups, Cartan, Weyl)
2. `docs/PAPER_PERSPECTIVES.md` (Domain-specific sections)
3. `docs/THEOREM_NUMBERING.md` (System for cross-referencing)
4. `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (Phase-by-phase execution)

Which would you like to see next?
